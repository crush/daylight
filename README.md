# Daylight

A revolutionary new dating site designed specifically to empower trans women
and feminine-identifying individuals looking to date men / masculine-
identifying individuals or each other.

Of course, non-binary, agender, genderfluid etc. folks are more than welcome,
too!

## Why the world needs Daylight

When people think of free/libre and open source software, they often think of
software that attempts to provide a free (as in freedom!) alternative to
proprietary, mainstream options.  While there are important ethical, economic
and social implications of doing this work, mainstream opinion would suggest
that innovation is only happening in industry.  The following assertions are
critical to the philosophy driving Daylight's development:

  * Software meant for public use should prioritize (interpersonal) experiences.
  * Social innovations should challenge industry trends.
  * Innovation in community protections should seek to:
    1. Reliably and effectively protect users from abuse and danger.
    2. Provider users with effective & transparent safety & privacy controls.
  * At the end of the day, software should be fun to use.

Daylight is being designed to embody each of these values.  It is my hope that
we can show that software doesn't need to make people billionaires to be
successful and that there is an apetite for software that can boldly disregard
assumptions about how software must operate.

Artsy bullshit aside, I hope you'll find Daylight a joy to use.  I hope you
will feel safe, empowered and rewarded for investing time in it.
